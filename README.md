# NERDR - Front-End of a Simple Twitter like platform

###### This is part one of a project for InnoTech College. The idea is showcase our Vue skills by coding the front-end of a Twitter like platform. Part two will consist of the back-end. Style wise, I wanted to curate this platform to fit more of my personality rather than just a Twitter clone. NERDR is mobile and desktop compatible.
